## Description
---
A small little project done towards to end of summer to see what I have learned from learning web dev.

Vanilla JS was used to test the extent of what I have learned while attempting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Storage of user watchlist data is done via [Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
